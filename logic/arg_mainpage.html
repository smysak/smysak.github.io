    <h3>Logic and Argumentation</h3>
    <p>As you have seen by now, there are many ways to convince an audience of what you want them to believe. Broadly speaking, you can 
        appeal to their sense of honor, their emotions, or use logic to persuade them. Which method is best? That depends on the 
        circumstances, of course. However, in an ideal world, logic is the best tool of persuasion. It does not rely on authority, nor 
        does it rely on the manipulation of any feelings. When properly applied, logic is capable <em>only</em> of promoting the truth, 
        and does not allow for ulterior motives. In theory, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>For the third course section, we are going to value logic higher than the other modes of persuasion. We are going to practice using 
        <i>logos</i> to express ourselves to others, and evaluate the methods of doing so.
