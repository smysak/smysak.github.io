    <h3>Theme</h3>
    <p>Every piece of literature explores a <i>theme</i>. It is usually easy to recognize - the author <em>wants</em> you to feel and 
        understand the theme, after all. In fact, there may be multiple themes for you to appreciate in one piece of literature. The 
        difficulty arises when we try to give name to the themes we explore. This is because themes are <em>big ideas</em>, ideas which 
        are hard to put precicely into words.</p>
    <p>What is <em>love</em>? What is <em>justice</em>? What is <em>victory</em>? The words fail to encapsulate their meanings, yet when 
        we add more to their description, it feels that we merely fall further from the mark. That is because these <i>things</i> are not 
        things. They are relations, which exist between things in the material world. Though our words are very good at representing 
        material things and actions, they struggle to adequately describe relations to the fullest extent of their significance. This is 
        precisely why the bulk of literature exists. There may be no better way to describe these immaterials, than in a novel in which 
        characters grapple with their effects or with the concepts themselves.</p>

    <h3>Motif</h3>
    <p>The term, <i>motif</i> actually comes from classical music. There, it refers to a small piece of melody that recurrs within a 
        larger work or composition, and used to convey significance, leading the audience's attention to the thematic content. Think of 
        the opening to Beethoven's 5th symphony (you know it - Dun dun dun DUUUN). Deep and brooding, this sequence of notes is repeated 
        throughout the work, and conveys the feelings and ideas which Beethoven wished to explore.</p>
    <p>A motif works the same way in literature. Instead of a repeated melody, it might be a repeated image or event.</p>
