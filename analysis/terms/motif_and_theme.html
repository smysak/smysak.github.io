    <h3>Theme</h3>
    <p>Every piece of literature explores a <i>theme</i>. It is usually easy to recognize - the author <em>wants</em> you to feel and 
        understand the theme, after all. In fact, there may be multiple themes for you to appreciate in one piece of literature. The 
        difficulty arises when we try to give name to the themes we explore. This is because themes are <em>big ideas</em>, ideas which 
        are hard to put precicely into words.</p>
    <p>What is <em>love</em>? What is <em>justice</em>? What is <em>victory</em>? The words fail to encapsulate their meanings, yet when 
        we add more to their description, it feels that we merely fall further from the mark. That is because these <i>things</i> are not 
        things. They are relations, which exist between things in the material world. Though our words are very good at representing 
        material things and actions, they struggle to adequately describe relations to the fullest extent of their significance. This is 
        precisely why the bulk of literature exists. There may be no better way to describe these immaterials, than in a novel in which 
        characters grapple with them.</p>
