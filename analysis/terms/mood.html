    <h3>Mood</h3>
    <p>In literature, <i>mood</i> can be seen as the culmination of the many choices an author makes. It is the effect, overall feeling, 
        or <i>atmosphere</i> that the reader is immersed in. The setting, imagery used, words chosen... every inclusion (or exclusion) 
        made by the author contributes to the overall <em>presence of a story</em>.

    <p>As you read Harrison Bergeron, pay attention to the overall feeling which the piece exudes. The author is known for his excellent 
        sense of wit. Here, he has leveled that wit against a certain trend that he felt growing in society at large. Yet, dry (or dark) 
        humour aside, is the piece comedic? Does the <i>mood</i> allow us to find mirth in the mockery? Or does it produce something very 
        different in its reader?
