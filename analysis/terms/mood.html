    <h3>Mood</h3>
    <p>In literature, <i>mood</i> can be seen as the culmination of the many choices an author makes. It is the effect, overall feeling, 
        or <i>atmosphere</i> that the reader is immersed in. The setting, imagery used, words chosen... every inclusion (or exclusion) 
        made by the author contributes to the overall <em>presence of a story</em>.
