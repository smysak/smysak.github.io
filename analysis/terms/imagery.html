    <h3>Imagery</h3>
    <p>Good writing can inspire the reader to think. Great writing can inspire a reader to feel. But what if writing can inspire us to 
        <em>see, taste, or touch</em>?
    </p>
    <p>Some authors are able to go beyond simple description to provide accounts of sensory experiences well enough that they can transmit 
        that experience <i>directly</i> to a receptive reader. This technique is called <b>imagery</b>, and allows for greater emotional 
        depth and connection.

    <p><a href="../../readings/fiction/imagery/christmas_memory_capote.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Christmas Memory</a> 
        by Truman Capote is a masterpiece of sensory detail. As you read, pay attention to the <i>smells</i> and <i>tastes</i> that are 
        evoked by the language. As you read, ask whether this imagery has a purpose beyond mere decoration - what feelings can it connect 
        you with?

    <p>In <a href="../../readings/fiction/imagery/pit_pendulum_poe.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pit and The Pendulum</a>, 
        E.A. Poe proves himself to be the master of gothic imagery, using it to create unbearable suspense and allowing the reader to 
        physically experience the terror of his first-person narrator.
