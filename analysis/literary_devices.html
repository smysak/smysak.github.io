    <h3>Literary Devices</h3>
    <p>In order to study writing, we must be able to talk about it. Building on the basic terms we have already studied in the first 
        section of the course, we will explore some of the techniques that authors use to convey their meaning and highlight 
        important ideas within a text. We will refer to these tools as <i>literary devices</i>. Although technically all of the terms we 
        studied in the first section of the course (<a href="basic_terms.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) are 
        literary devices, they are broad tools, used to set out a structure or add life and flavour to a text. Here, we will discuss 
        more specific tools that writers have at their disposal, in the context of non-fiction writing.</p>
    <p>One great advantage we have, when studying non-fiction writing, is that authors are often quite clear about their intended 
        meaning.</p>

<p>In order to study non-fiction writing, we must understand the purpose of the following literary terms and devices:</p>
<ul>
    <li><h4>Thesis</h4>
        <p>A <i>thesis</i> is the central claim that an author makes in a piece of writing. It establishes the point of view of the 
            author, and presents the main argument or idea of the text. It is often a clear statement of an author's purpose, i.e., 
            when the author's purpose is to prove the truth or veracity of that thesis. Becoming able to identify the thesis of a 
            piece of writing is both a fundamental and challenging step toward broader education.</p>

    </li>
    <li><h4>Claim</h4>
        <p>A <i>claim</i> is the way we refer to an appeal to knowledge by the author. Any time an author asserts that something is 
            true, or assumes or relies on the truth of something, we say that they are making a <strong>claim (to knowledge)</strong>. 
            A good writer will always back up their claims with some sort of <i>evidence</i>. Learning how to recognize claims and 
            evidence is an essential part of learning to engage with non-fiction texts at an academic level.

    </li>
        <li><h4>Diction</h4>
        <p><i>Diction</i> refers to the specific choice of words used by the author. Two words might mean the same thing (such as <i>
            push</i> and <i>shove</i>) but have very different feelings attached to them. Would you appreciate a push to help you reach 
            your goal? Or, do you need a shove?</p>

    </li>
    <li><h4>Tone</h4>
        <p>The <i>tone</i> conveys the author's attitude toward the subject of their writing. Although sometimes an author's attitude 
        is apparent from the beginning of their writing, we often take note of it when the tone <em>shifts</em>. A change in tone can 
        signify dramatic changes in the author's way of thinking. It can also encourage the reader to shift <em>their</em> attitudes 
        alongside the author.</p>

</ul>

<br />
<p>To enhance our appreciation of the devices authors have at their disposal, we can take a look at the following as well:</p>
<ul>
    <li><h4>Irony</h4>
        <p>When an author's intended meaning is the opposite of the literal meaning of their words or writing, we say that they are 
            being <i>ironic</i>. It has nothing to do with the metal that has a similar-sounding name.

    </li>
    <li><h4>Anecdote</h4>
        <p>An <i>anecdote</i> is a short story about a real person or interaction, that has some relevance to the discussion at hand.
        </p>
        <h4>Allegory</h4>
        <p>An <i>allegory</i> is a short story that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning.</p>
        <h4>Aphorism</h4>
        <p>An <i>aphorism</i> is a short observation that contains a deep truth. </p>
        <h4>Allusion</h4>
        <p>An <i>allusion</i> is an indirect reference - a way of drawing attention to something, without mentioning it explicitly.</p>
