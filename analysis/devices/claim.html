    <p>In this <a href="../../readings/non-fiction/claim/chiang_ai_art.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a>, popular 
        author Ted Chiang makes a strong claim that the creations of A.I. aren't worthy of being called <em>art</em>. He reinforces this 
        overall claim (his <i>thesis</i>) with further claims, and, crucially, <em>evidence</em> that supports those claims. Pay 
        attention also to how he <i>qualifies</i> his claims, explaining how the use of A.I. could be considered an art <em>in some 
        cases</em>, and the admission that he cannot account for new developments in the far future. These serve to strengthen his claims 
        about the inability for our current forms of A.I. to produce anything that we can meaningfully refer to as <em>art</em>.

<!--Students must learn:


Try to train your mind to think this way. The author makes a claim to knowledge. The author *DOES NOT SIMPLY SAY THAT SOMETHING IS TRUE*

The author claims to know something.
