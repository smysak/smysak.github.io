    <h3>Tone</h3>

    <p>Read this <a href="../../readings/non-fiction/tone/wallace_water.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">transcript</a> of 
        the 2005 commencement speech to the graduating class at Kenyon College, delivered by David Foster Wallace. Commencement speeches 
        quite often make for excellent studies, as the formal requirements of the occasion necessitate a particular tone on the part of 
        the speaker. Add to this the speaker's desire to not bore their audience by sounding overly didactic, and the result is a 
        masterclass in the use of tone, especially from such a clever writer.

    <p>In this <a href="../../readings/non-fiction/tone/thompson_advice.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter to a friend</a> 
        the young Hunter S. Thompson gives his best response to a request for advice. Even at the young age of 22, the author's patented 
        and very readable style is immediately noticable. Pay close attention to the techniques he uses to convey tone, and the way in 
        which he uses that tone to mediate between the instructional nature of his message and the obvious desire to not appear arrogant 
        before his intimate.
