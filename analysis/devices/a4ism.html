    <h3>Anecdote, Allegory, Aphorism, and Allusion</h3>
    <p>When an author wishes to break their audience away from their usual modes of thought and understanding, whether to simply re-set 
        their perspective in the course of a line of reasoning, or to encourage them to think inwardly, or to imagine themselves in a 
        similar situation, the way to do this is through one of these devices:        
    </p>
    <p>An <b>anecdote</b> is a short story, like one you would tell a neighbour, or one you would tell a friend about a neighbour. When 
        employed as a device, it encourages the reader to view a situation from a common perspective; from the perspective of a lived 
        reality. It can very effectively provide a example, serve as evidence to support a claim, and bring a reader down to earth.
    </p>
    <p>An <b>allegory</b> is a story, longer and more detailed than an anecdote, which can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning. 
    
    </p>
    <p>An <b>aphorism</b> is a truism, an adage - a clever statement of general wisdom. It reminds us of what we know to be true, and 
        can give us pause to consider; re-setting us, and anchoring us in the here and now.
    </p>
    <p>An <b>allusion</b> is an indirect reference, an expression designed to call to mind the object of the one who alludes.

    <p>Possibly the most famous <b>allegory</b> in the English-speaking world, Plato's 
        <a href="../../readings/non-fiction/aaaa/cave_allegory.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">allegory of the cave</a> 
        was written more than 2,000 years ago, in Ancient Greece (and definitely not in the English language). In it, a story about 
        prisoners in a cave becomes a rich stage for an examination of education, perception, reality, and more.

    <p>In <a href="../../readings/non-fiction/aaaa/choose_exile_wright.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">I Choose Exile</a> 
        American author Richard Wright makes use of an <b>anecdote</b> to drive home his point about the difference between American 
        and European attitudes toward race.
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps one of the most enduring characters from modern English fiction is the (Dutch) Professor Van Helsing. I can think of 
        at least five iterations of his character, from appearances in comic books, anime, and film. The popularity of the character 
        is assured by the strength of the original, and here, in this 
        <a href="../../readings/non-fiction/aaaa/king_laugh.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">excerpt from Dracula</a> 
        he makes <b>allusion</b> to some great mystery, hidden in the depths of human suffering.
    </p>
    <p>One of the strongest uses of an <b>aphorism</b>, employed as a rhetorical device, is exemplified by the 
        <a href="../../readings/non-fiction/aaaa/funeral_oration.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">funeral oration</a> in 
        William Shakespeare's <i>Julius Caesar</i>. Here, Marc Anthony delivers a speech about the controversial leader. The aphorism 
        is found in the third and fourth lines of the verse, and it disarms the audience of any ill-will they still hold toward the 
        deceased.
