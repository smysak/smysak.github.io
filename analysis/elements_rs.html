    <h3>Elements of the Rhetorical Situation</h3>
    <p>When we read a piece of writing, we can consider it alone, separate and apart. But even if we view something as <i>apart</i>, 
        it nevertheless is <i>a part</i> of a greater whole. This greater whole, in the context of any text, is referred to as its 
        rhetorical situation.</p>
    <p>There are a number of elements to the rhetorical situation of any text. We shall consider them here. Every element is 
        interconnected, so the questions you will ask when examining each of them may be similar to another, only mirrored in terms of 
        perspective.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Text</h4>
            <p>Any form of communication that humans create. The medium of communication itself is worthy to make note of, since a 
                speech in front of an audience will come across differently than if it were published in a newspaper. Authors take this 
                into account when writing, so in order to study their writing, you should too.
            </p>
            <p>Ask:
            <ul>
                <li>What is the medium of communication?</li>
                <li>How has the writer edited themselves, to take advantage of, or in light of, their chosen medium?</li>
                <li>Did the author choose this medium, or was it the only choice available to them at the time?</li>
            </ul></p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Context</h4>
            <p>All texts are created within the scope of their author's conscious understanding. When seeking to understand a text, the 
                time, place, and any specific circumstances relating to its creation are of great importance.
            </p>
            <p>Ask:
            <ul>
                <li>Is there a specific occasion that called for the creation of the text?</li>
                <li>What specific cultural or historical event is the text connected with?</li>
            </ul></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Author</h4>
            <p>Just as frequently referred to as the <b>writer</b>, the creator of a text presents a perspective shaped by a number of 
                factors. Their background, their thoughts on the subject, as well as whether they have <i>skin in the game</i> (i.e. 
                whether they have <i>something to gain</i> from presenting a particular perspective), should all be taken into account 
                when studying a source.
            </p>
            <p>Ask:
            <ul>
                <li>Who is the author, and what does he know about the subject?</li>
                <li>What is the writer's relationship to the subject and to the audience?</li>
                <li>What values, ideas, and beliefs does the writer hold about the subject?</li>
            </ul></p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Audience</h4>
            <p>The indended audience of a text. An author might write very differently, depending on their chosen audience. And, the 
                author has chosen their audience for a <em>reason</em>. Understanding this reason will be key to gaining an understaning 
                of the text.
            </p>
            <p>Ask:
            <ul>
                <li>Who was this text written for?</li>
                <li>Why is the author addressing this audience, in particular?</li>
                <li>Based on your cultural knowledge, what values, ideas, and beliefs are likely held by the audience?</li>
                <li>Is the audience likely to be resistant to any values, ideas, or beliefs which the author holds on the subject?</li>
            </ul></p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Subject</h4>
            <p>What the text is about.</p>
            <p>Ask:
            <ul>
                <li>Is there anything about the subject matter which could be considered controversial? (Is dealing with it likely to 
                    cause offense to anyone?)</li>
                <li>Of what significance is the subject to the lives of the author and the audience?</li>
            </ul></p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Exigence</h4>
            <p>The exigence is what inspired the writer to produce the text. It could be anything - if the writer decided that a text 
                was necessary, there must have been something which sparked or prompted that decision. Finding out, or even just 
                speculating upon the exigence of the text can be a source of great insight when examining a rhetorical situation.
            </p>
            <p>Ask:
            <ul>
                <li>What motivated the author to create this text?</li>
            </ul></p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>The purpose is what the writer wishes the text to do. It encompases both what the writer hopes the text itself 
                accomplishes (that it presents an argument well, or that it starts a conversation on a given subject), and what the 
                writer hopes will be accomplished <i>through</i> the text.
            </p>
            <p>Ask:
            <ul>
                <li>What is the straightforward <i>purpose</i> of the text? Is it to inform, to narrate, to persuade, or evaluate?</li>
                <li>Is there another possible purpose? Sometimes a text which appears on the surface to merely inform, may also 
                    prove to be persuasive...</li>
                <li>Why did the author choose to create this text for this particular audience?</li>
            </ul></p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Message</h4>
            <p>Whatever the text, to be worthy of study, it must include a central <b>claim</b>. The message of the text itself <i>is</i> 
                the writer's claim, developed with reasoning and evidence. It is what the writer seeks to <i>get through</i> to the 
                audience.
            </p>
            <p>Ask:
            <ul>
                <li>What is the writer's central claim?</li>
                <li>What idea does the author put forward, and support with evidence and reason?</li>
            </ul></p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Genre</h4>
            <p>What the audience expects from an author, when dealing with a specific subject matter.</p>
            <p>Ask:
            <ul>
                <li>What previous texts (relating similarly to the subject) have the audience likely been exposed to?</li>
            </ul></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>The elements of the rhetorical situation, and their relations between them, can be represented as a diagram:</p>
    <img src="../images/rhet_sit_diagram.jpg" width="430" height="auto" alt="A diagram showing the relation between different elements of the rhetorical situation">
    <p>Take your time to understand each element and how it relates to the others. It may seem complex at first glance, but with some 
        practice, you'll find that you can apply it to any text quite easily.</p>
    <p>Once you're armed with the words to describe the elements of the rhetorical situation, we can begin to analyze the choices 
        authors have made when creating texts.
