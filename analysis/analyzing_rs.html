    <h3>Analyzing the Rhetorical Situation</h3>
    <p>Being able to understand the choices which authors have made when creating texts is an important skill that will stay with you, 
        and remain useful your entire lives.
    </p>
    <p>Although all of the terms we have learned in this section of the course are also applicable to the analysis of (fiction) 
        literature, we will deal here mainly with non-fiction texts.
    </p>

    <p>Authors appeal to three broad senses in their readers. Most effective texts appeal to each of the three categories below, in 
        their own way, although authors usually focus on one "road to the reader's heart" more than others. When referring to these 
        senses in the context of analyzing rhetoric, we use the terminology of Aristotle, who first categorized and studied their 
        use. This is why the words we use are the ancient Greek words for feeling, character (as in <i>moral character</i>), and 
        logic, respectively:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Pathos (Feeling)</h4>
            <p>You've probably encountered <i>pathos</i> before, in words like sym<i>pathy</i> and em<i>pathy</i>. Authors often make 
                an <strong>appeal to emotion</strong> to get the result they want from an audience.
            </p>
            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Ethos (Moral Character)</h4>
            <p>Although <i>ethos</i> means <i>ethics</i> directly, when we consider the 'moral character' of a speaker, we do it 
            specifically to determine how <i>credible</i> they are as a speaker. With this in mind, you can also think of the author 
            employing ethos as making an appeal to the audience's <strong>sense of credibility</strong>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Logos (Logic / Intelligibility)</h4>
            <p>If possible, authors will usually attempt an <strong>appeal to intellect</strong>, employing claims and evidence to 
                present a logical case to their audience. <em>It is not always possible to do so.</em> Still, even if it is impossible, 
                most authors will at least try to make what they are presenting seem grounded in facts and evidence. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Note well that the clever use of <i>ethos</i> can make it seem that a claim is correct and true, even when there is no 
                <i>logos</i> employed. For example, the use of technical jargon (intelligent-sounding words) can make it seem like the 
                author is putting forth a reasonable case, when they are, in fact, not. 
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>There are two more senses that authors count on for effect, although they are a bit more subtle than the three listed above.
        They are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Kairos (Timing)</h4>
            <p>The use, and sense, of timing here is two-fold:</p>
            <p>The first has predominantly to do with the context of the piece of writing. No text is read, nor is any speech delivered 
                in a vacuum. Authors need to consider the events of the recent past, and the probable mood of their audience if they 
                want to avoid saying the right thing, at the wrong time.
            </p>
            <p>The second has to do with the delivery itself. Perhaps you've heard the phrase, 'comedic timing'. The idea is that, when 
                it comes to comedy, the joke or story that is being told isn't what makes us laugh, but rather, its effectiveness is in 
                the way it's told, or the <i>timing</i> of its delivery. The same is true of any text, whether written, or spoken. It 
                doesn't matter how receptive an audience is - if the content of the speech isn't executed in a pleasing manner, their
                engagement level will drop, possibly causing the message to become lost in their disappointment, or apathy.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Telos (Final Purpose)</h4>
            <p>The meaning behind <i>telos</i>, is a bit nuanced. Taken plainly, it refers to the ultimate aim or purpose of a text.</p>
            <p>It may seem strange to think of a texts purpose as being 'sensed' by a reader, but if you think instead of a reader's 
                <i>sense of purpose</i> you might get the idea. If an author can successfully appeal to the reader's sense of purpose 
                through their text, it can have a profound effect. Similarly, a reader might be able to sense the author's intention, 
                through their words. This is the meaning of <i>telos</i> in the rhetorical sense.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>At this point, we can begin our rhetorical analysis. Now that we have all of the terminology required, the process is really 
        quite simple:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What are the 
                <a href="elements_rs.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">elements</a> of this piece of writing's rhetorical 
                situation? You may need to fill the details in conceptually as you read, but gather as much as you can from the outset.
            </li>
            <li>Read the introduction, or the first paragraph of the text. Is there a 
                <a href="devices/thesis.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">thesis</a>? 
            </li>
            <li>Start reading the next paragraph. What 
                <a href="literary_devices.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">devices</a> can you notice the author using?
            </li>
            <li>What reasons do you think the author might have for using the device? What is the effect?</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 as necessary.</li>
            <li>Which of the audience's senses is the author appealing to, predominantly? (Is the author mostly using logos, ethos, or 
                pathos?) Why do you think they have chosen to appeal to this sense?
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>...and you're done! It's really not so complicated, once you have the right cognitive tools (read: words) for the task.</p>
