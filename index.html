    <hr>
    <p>This class is divided into three broad sections. Throughout this course, you will develop the intellectual tools 
        needed to analyze works of literature and understand the reasons behind the choices that authors make. You will also 
        be introduced to basic logic, and practice forming arguments to express your ideas and opinions in a clear and constructive
        manner.</p>
    <p>In this course, you will be exposed to language which you may find challenging. This is done purposefully, and is part
        of the learning process. Because of this, you will find a dictionary to be indispensable. You should use it dilligently
        and look up every piece of challenging diction you encounter. Frequent and proper use of a dictionary (especially a paper 
        dictionary) will pay back the small amount of effort you spend many times over. If you haven't developed the habit yet, 
        it is strongly recommended that you do so now.</p>
    <p>A <a href="https://www.lextutor.ca/conc/eng/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">concordancer</a> is another lexical 
        tool which you might find very useful. Learning how to use a concordancer takes a bit of practice, but if you put in the 
        effort, it will make academic writing much easier, and answer many of the questions and doubts that can make writing difficult 
        for a second-language speaker. A useful guide to proper concordancer use can be found 
        <a href="https://www.eapfoundation.com/guides/concordancer/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</a>

    <h3>Course Sections</h3>
    <p>There are three essential parts to the ELA Honors curriculum. Together, their purpose is to teach you to appreciate texts for 
        their artistic merits, understand texts in their broader context, and bring your writing up to meet the high expectations of
        the world's best universities.</p>
    </br>
    <h4>Literary Analysis</h4>
    <p>Being able to analyze works of fiction is an important skill that will enrich your life. Art, as a creation of man, is an
        important method of expression - especially when the message is abstract, or difficult to put into succinct words. Learning how 
        to engage with texts on a deeper level will help you to access these messages.</p><p>To enter this section of the course, click

    <br />
    <h4>Understanding the Rhetorical Situation</h4>
    <p>You're probably used to thinking of non-fiction texts as a convenient source of information. You may be familiar with methods 
        of quickly identifying important details within a text, and have practiced extracting them, perhaps as direct quotations, 
        to enrich your papers. However, accepting such information at face value might be a mistake. Even if the information is correct 
        and written with the intention of being completely truthful, you would still miss important nuances and background information,
        parts necessary to understand the text as a whole. Learning how to analyze non-fiction texts is an important skill that you will 
        draw on your entire life.</p><p>To access this section of the course, click

    <br />
    <h4>Logic and Argumentation</h4>
    <p>Being able to express your opinions clearly is a valuable skill. All the more so, if you can express your opinion persuasively.
        But what makes one opinion more persuasive than another? People tend to accept a point of view which is close to their own much 
        more readily than a point of view which differs greatly. In that case, perhaps we should speak of agreeable things to those who 
        find them agreeable. Or, do you disagree?</p><p>To explore this topic further, click
