    <h3>Q4 Rhetorical Analysis Assignment</h3>
    <br />
    <p>One important skill to have, is the ability to analyze what we call <i>the rhetorical situation</i>.</p>
    <p>This refers to the purpose, audience, topic, writer, and context of a piece of writing.</p>
    <p>Understanding how these variables have affected the text, how it was written, and how it was received, is important for understanding the piece as a whole.</p>
    <br />
    <p>For this assignment, you will study a piece of writing by Richard Louv. Specifically, you will read an excerpt from the introduction to his book, <i>The Last Child in the Woods</i>.</p>
    <p>You will then write a 750 word essay, commenting on the text.</p>
    <p>Click <a href="louv_woods.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to view the text in .pdf format.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Is Louv simply trying to sell his book? Did the publisher ask him to write an introduction to spark the reader's interest?</p>
    <p>Certainly that is a part of the rhetorical situation, but hardly worth commenting on.</p>
    <p>The important question you should ask is, <em>what was in the writer's heart as he composed the piece?</em></p>
    <br />
    <p>Ensure that as you write, you reflect on the following aspects of the rhetorical situation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the author's purpose</li>
        <li>the book's intended audience</li>
        <li>the broad topic that is being discussed in the writing</li>
        <li>who the author is</li>
        <li>the broader context (i.e. what is going on in the wider world, and how the text relates to the movements of history)</li>
    </ul>
