    <h3>Analyzing Literature</h3>
    <p>Literature is art, and art is <em>beautiful</em>.</p>
    <p>Like beauty, which is famously "in the eye of the beholder", the meaning and value of a pice of art is a very personal matter.
        Still, there is a natural inclination to ascribe meaning correctly, and there is a general consensus that one interpretation or 
        another must be "the correct one". This is what makes it fun. Each piece of art represents a reflection of the human soul, 
        transmitted across time and space; a puzzle for us to solve, a game to play, and perhaps, to win. The general consensus is that 
        an interpretation of art is 'good' if many people agree with it, but this is not necessarily the case. Try it for yourself, and 
        evaluate the outcome.
    </p>
    <p>The first step toward learning how to interpret art is to develop our faculty of <i>discernment</i>. Few people understand this 
        faculty correctly, because they have become too accustomed to its use. They take it for granted. Put simply, discernment is the 
        faculty which allows you to tell right from left, up from down, happy from sad, etc. from etc. It is eminently useful, and we 
        practice it by examining collections of items to find the odd-one out and such, until the third or so grade of elementary school, 
        at which point we move on to maths. We like maths, as a society, because the divisions between the elements of maths are so clear 
        and simply expressed. We want people to be able to discern such simple differences, but we do not want them to be able to discern 
        too well, lest they start making <em>judgements</em>. Yet, being able to do so is an incredibly valuable skill.
    </p>
    <p>Discernment allows us to notice and identify components in a piece of art which are worthy of interpretation. It allows us to 
        identify choices which creators have made, and allows us to ask why they chose to create the piece of work <em>like so</em> and 
        not otherwise. When we ask these questions, it allows us to consider the potential <em>meaning</em> behind the piece.
    </p>
    <p>They say that a picture is worth a thousand words - in that case, to save time reading, it will be convenient for us to begin to 
        practice this art of interpretation on several images before we set about applying it to literature. Take a look at the following 
        works of art, and pay careful attention to any details you notice. Discern the important features, and ask yourself why the author 
        decided to include it in their work. What could it mean?
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Image #1 - <a href="interpret_pics/zig_ur.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Ziggurat of Ur</a></li>
    <li>Image #2 - <a href="interpret_pics/ceiling_shrine.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portion of a ceiling at the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh</a></li>
    <li>Image #3 - <a href="interpret_pics/stony.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pierreuse</a></li>
    <li>Image #4 - <a href="interpret_pics/blanchisseuse.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">La Blanchisseuse</a></li>
    <li>Image #5 - <a href="interpret_pics/scream.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Scream</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a piece of art makes you feel one way, it isn't hard to imagine that it makes others feel the same way. So, feel free to 
        interpret art for yourself, and be confident to assume that you are correct and that others will agree with you. If this sounds 
        paradoxical to what was said before (about it being in the <i>eye of the beholder</i>), that's just how it is. If you look at the 
        same piece of art later, and decide on a new interpretation, that only means that such <em>layers</em> of meaning are possible.        
    </p>
    <p>Everyone understands everything according to their current modes of understanding. As they develop, they understand according to 
        future modes of understanding.
    </p>
    <p>The most important thing that <em>you</em> can do, is to <strong>activate your curiousity</strong>. Without curiousity, there can 
        be no development. As we look, read, and live, we must ask ourselves continuously:
        <ul>
            <li>What is to be gained here?</li>
            <li>How can I relate this to my life?</li>
            <li>What is <em>the author</em> trying to tell me?</li>
        </ul>
        If you practice this, I am certain that you will quickly see the benefits of the approach.
    </p>
