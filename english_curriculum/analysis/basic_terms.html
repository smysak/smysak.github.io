    <h3>Literary Terminology</h3>
<p>In order to study literature, writing, or in general, anything at all, one quickly finds it necessary to be able to <i>talk</i> about 
    the subject of study (whether to oneself or others). In order for it to be examined, we must be able to fit it into a form of 
    <i>discourse</i> (which is just a fancy way of saying 'communication').</p>
<p>If you're paying attention, you'll have noticed that we've just said the same thing, twice. That's because it's so simple, and 
    so important, at the same time: Think about it. How does one even <em>think</em> without putting particular details into language?</p>
<p>In any case, a little reflection will show that, in order to study any text, one must be able to identify and discuss particular 
    details within the text, and discuss their effect alongside other particular details. Giving name to something gives us the ability 
    to isolate it; to talk about <em>that thing</em> in particular. It gives us a sort of power over what is named. This is what literary 
    terms are, in essence. They are <em>names</em> by which we can identify and isolate elements of a text, or decisions made by the 
    authors of a text so that they may be included into a discourse.</p>

<p>In order to begin to study literature, we should know the following terms:</p>
<ul>
    <li><h4>Narrative</h4>
        <p><i>Narrative</i> refers to the story being told in a piece of writing or other work of art.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Plot</h4>
        <p>The <i>plot</i> is the 'mapping' of events in a narrative. One event influences another.</p>

            and narrative.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li><h4>Character</h4>
        <p>The <i>characters</i> in a story advance its plot.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Setting</h4>
        <p>The <i>setting</i> is the world which characters inhabit. The author has chosen the setting to explore a concept.</p>

            the literary definition of characters and their settings.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li><h4>Theme</h4>
        <p>A <i>theme</i> is the 'big idea' that underlies a story. Writers write fiction in order to explore these ideas within a 
        hypothetical world.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Motif</h4>
        <p>A <i>motif</i> is a recurring pattern in a piece of literature.</p>
        <ul><li><a href="terms/motif_and_theme.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click</a> for more details about 
            motifs and themes in literature.</li></ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>These terms describe the broad patterns that we can identify in fiction literature. They constitute the broad framework of a text, 
    and allow us to talk about it's general structure and the fundamental ideas that constitute the work's underlying premise.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>In order to further our study of literature, and begin to study the writing <em>within</em> the broad framework, we should know the 
    following terms:</p>
<ul>
    <li><h4>Metaphor</h4>
        <p>A <i>metaphor</i> identifies a shared quality between two things, without explaining the comparison.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Simile</h4>
        <p>A <i>simile</i> is a direct comparison between two things.</p>
        <ul><li><a href="terms/metaphor_and_simile.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click</a> for more details about 
        metaphor and simile.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li><h4>Imagery</h4>
        <p><i>Imagery</i> refers to the mental images a writer can evoke through their writing.</p>

    </li>
    <br />
    <li><h4>Mood</h4>
        <p>Texts are usually written to produce an emotional effect in the reader. The overall feeling one receives from a text is 
            referred to as its <i>mood</i>.</p>

        writing.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><h4>Symbol</h4>
        <p>A symbol is a type of sign. As a sign, it is significant. It signifies meaning.</p>
