    <h3>Q4 Literature Assignments</h3>
    <br />
    <p>Let's study some famous works of fiction. This quarter, we will examine themes present in the broad, "horror" genre.</p>
    <p>We will look at three short pieces, published between the 19th and early 20th centuries by notable authors.</p>
    <br />

        <li>
            <hr>
            <p>Read <i>The Mask of the Red Death</i> by E.A. Poe and identify three uses of symbolism.</p>
            <p>Include the reason why they are used, the effect they have, AND explain the overall meaning, as you understand it.</p>
            <p>You should write about 50 words for each symbol you identify, but the important thing is to complete the task successfully.</p>
